# redesigned-goggles
Simple YouTube wrapper. Gives video details(title, preview, etc.) and direct video URL.
# Why redisigned-goggles?
Because github suggested that name.
# Installation and Usage
Download file to your webserver.	

Go to http://(your webserver IP/domain)/(path to file, if it is in root - ignore it)video.php?v=(YouTube Video ID)

Example: http://127.0.0.1/video.php?v=DLzxrzFCyOs

If you did everything right, it will return JSON string. 

Read more info in file itself, i'm too lazy to update readme.md.
